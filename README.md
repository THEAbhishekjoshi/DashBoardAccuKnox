React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

@vitejs/plugin-react
 uses Babel
 for Fast Refresh

@vitejs/plugin-react-swc
 uses SWC
 for Fast Refresh

Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the TS template
 for information on how to integrate TypeScript and typescript-eslint
 in your project.
